Here's a poem I wrote -

he dropped into the wishing well a fading copper coin
he often flipped to tails or heads to settle on his path
it bounced and clanged across the sides
a rhythmic chant like rolling tides
inevitably silenced by collision with the floor

the turbulence that followed carved a path into the deep
the wind playing his whispered prayer across the jagged walls
which forked and wove and ramified
syllables stretched and amplified
until the words were scattered by the structure of the rocks

then murmur joined with murmur as the coin joined with its mates:
those trinkets, cheap or valuable, that marked the wishes wished
whose voices grew in ones and twos -
a yearning tune, a lover's swoon
gathered into a maelstrom by the echo of the well

softly spoke the wishing well with borrowed breath and words
that danced over the jaggedness like shadows through the years
of hope and pain and loss and gain
now echoed, changed and rearranged
the latest known infection of the spreading Babel plague
